# App-Search

This project was just a test challenge for a job.

A simple search page for artists and bands. Angular 7, SASS and JSON-SERVER to simulate a API REST.

## Install
Run `sudo npm i`. If any error occurr, try run `sudo npm i --unsafe-perm node-sass`, then `sudo npm i`.

## Development server

Run `json-server --watch db.json` and then, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
